# Editor2D

## Description
Editor2D is a simple 2D image editor designed to work with PNM format images, supporting `.pbm`, `.pgm`, and `.ppm` files. The application allows users to open images, apply a series of filters, and export the results in various formats. It is an ideal project for anyone looking to modify images quickly and intuitively.

## Features

- **Open Images**: Allows users to open images in supported PNM formats.
  
- **Filter Pipeline**: Users can set up a pipeline of filters to apply to the image. Available filters include:
  - Flip horizontally (side by side)
  - Flip vertically (up down)
  - Rotate clockwise 90Â°
  - Rotate counterclockwise 90Â°
  - Negative colors

- **Execute Pipeline**: Once created, the filter pipeline can be executed to apply changes to the image. Users can also clear the pipeline at any time.

- **Image Export**: Images can be exported in `.pbm`, `.pgm`, and `.ppm` formats, regardless of the currently opened image format. The application automatically handles necessary conversions.

- **Language Customization**: Users can choose between English and Italian for the user interface.

- **Undo and Redo Functionality (under development)**: The editor supports undo and redo, allowing users to easily revert to the previous or next image state (if an undo operation has been performed).

- **Zoom In and Zoom Out**: Users can perform progressive zoom in and out on the image for detailed analysis.

- **Help and Information**: The app includes a "Help -> About" section that displays developer information and additional details about the application.
